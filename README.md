# build gh pages script
I can't be bothered to run the same command over and over again. So I built a script for it!

# How to use
## 1. `git clone git@github.com:danagilliann/build-gh-pages.git`
## 2. Alias the build_gh_pages.py file to your bash_profile
## 3. Source your bash_profile
## 4. Run your alias on your command line
